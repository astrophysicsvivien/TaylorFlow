The Future work folder contain ipynb files that were being worked on and have problems at the end of the MSc project.
Currently there are two files here, the first is tf_BNS where it was attempted to recover parameters from the BNS merger GW170817. The TaylorFlow functions are outputing data but the signal cannot currently be found. I suspect the problem lies with thew filtering or whitening of the detector data.
The second is TF_PYCBC_BNS, the goal of this script was similar to tf_BNS except that I attempted to port TaylorFlow waveforms into PyCBC data types and use them to find the signal, this similarly failed. Again, I suspect the filtering or whitening of the data.
